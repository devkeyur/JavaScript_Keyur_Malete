    Evolution Of javaScript
        -> in early days of web [1990]
            Browser : Mosaic
            Markup  : GML,SGML,HTML
            Script  : ECMA Script

        -> In 1995 Netscape
            Browser : Netscape communicator
            markup  : HTML
            Script  : ECMA Script

        -> In 1996 Netscape appointed "Brendan Eich" to design a Script fro browser
            Script => Mocha => Live Script
        
        -> NetScape given the responsibility of Live Script to " Sun Micro System [Java]"
            => Sun microSystem renamed Live script to JavaScript
        -> In year 2000 Netscape stopped its services and javascript
        -> Netscape => javascript => ECMA => ECMA 2015[ES5]....ECMA script 2022[ES2022]


    JavaScript
        - JavaScript is an light interpreted and JIT [Just in time] complied language.
        - interpreted language ca translate the code line by line
        - Complied language can translate all line simultaneously at the same time.
        - There are 2 compile technique
           > JIT [Just in time]
           > AOT [Ahead of time]
        - JIT translates the code in browser
        - AOT translates the application level

            => Compilers => babel, V8

        => javascript is used in various programming approaches
            > CLient side       - HTML
            > Server Side       - NodeJS
            > Database          - MongoDB
            > Animation[CAD]    - Flash, 3Ds MAX..

        => JavaScript supports various programming approaches
            > Functional Programming
            > Structural Programming
            > Imperative Programming
            > Modular Programming
            > Object Oriented Programming
                Note : Javascript is not an OOP language. it supports only few features of OOP.
