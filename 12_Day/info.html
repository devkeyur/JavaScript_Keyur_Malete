Null, Undefined, Symbol and Non Primitive Types

Primitive Data types
- Number
- String
- Boolean

                                BigInt
- It is a new data type for large integer values.
- Large integers have memory issues.
- E5+ version introduced a new way of configuring large integers called BigInt.
- You can configure Large Integers by using "n" as suffix or by using
    "Number.MAX-SAFE-INTEGER()

<script>
    var price = 9993838281n;
    document.write(`Price=${price}`);
</script>

                            Symbol
- It configures a hidden key for object.
- Key is ignored over iterations and other collection operations.
But it is available to handle individually.

Syntax:
       var  Id = Symbol();

       var  product = {
        [Id] : 1,
        Name: "TV",
        Price : 30400.22
        }

       for(var key in product)
       {
         document.write(`${key} <br>`);
       }
       document.write(`Product Id=${product[Id]}`);


                             Undefined
       - It configures that a variable reference is defined but value is not defined.
       - Undefined is the type configured for variable at compile time.
       
       Syntax:
               var x;
               document.write("x=" + x);        x = undefined
       
       - You can verify value by using the keyword "undefined".
               Bad:
               if(x==undefined)
               {
                  // please provide a value;
               }
               else
               {
                 // print the value;
               }
                 Good:
               if(x) {
                   // defined;
               } else {
                   // undefined;
               }
