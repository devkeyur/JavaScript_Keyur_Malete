<!-- Array Configuration -->

Configuring Array:
- It comprises of 2 phases
    a) Declaring Array
    b) Intializing or Assigning memory for Array

- Declaring Array is same as other variable types, you can use var, let & const.

    var products;
    let  categories;
    const users;

- Array memory is initialized or assigned by using 2 techniques
    a)  [ ]        Array meta character
    b)  Array()    Array constructor

    var products = [ ];            or        var products;
                                    products = [ ];

   
    var products = new Array()    or        var products;
                                    products = new Array();

Note: "new" is dynamic memory allocation operator.

FAQ: What is difference between  "[ ]" & Array()?
Ans:
     [ ]     configures static memory, the memory allocated will continue across multiple
        requests.

    Array()  configures dynamic memory, the memory allocated will be discreet. It is
              newly allocated every time when requested.

Storing Data into Array:
- You can initialize values into array meta character or Array() constructor.

    var values = [10, "A", true];
    var values = new Array(10, "A", true);

- You can assign value into array memory by the reference of property.
- Property is a string type that maps the Index number.

     var values  = [ ];
     values[0] = 10;            =>  0 & 1 are properties [string type]
     values["1"] = "A";
