<!-- Object Type
  - The concept of object is introduced into computer programming in early 1960's by  
    "Alan Kay".
  - It is used to keep all related data and logic together.
  - Object uses Key and Value collection.
  - You can store values under the reference of keys.
  - Key is string type and value can be any type.

    Syntax:
        var  product = {
            "Key" : value,
            "Key" : value,
            "Key" : function() { }
        }

   - If object comprises of only data, not any logic then it is reffered as "JSON".
   - JSON is JavaScript Object Notation, It is a format for data.

   Note: Web data is kept in 2 major formats
        a) XML    [Extensible Markup Language]
        b) JSON  [JavaScript Object Notation]

    Syntax:
          var product = {
            "Name": "TV",
            "Price": 45000.44,
            "Stock": true,
            "Cities": ["Delhi", "Hyd"],
            "Rating": { "Rate": 4.2, "Count": 4500 }
           }

     - You can access the data with reference of key name.

        product.Name            => TV
       
     - You can assign new value

        product.Name = "Samsung TV";

     - ES6 technique
       
        product[Name]            => Samsung TV -->
