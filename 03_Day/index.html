<!--
    javaScript can refer HTML elements?
    1. JavaScript can refer HTML elements by using DOM hierarchy.

Syntax:
    window.document.images[ ]
    window.document.forms[ ].elements[ ]
    window.document.all[]

    - It is the fastest way of accessing HTML elements for interpreter or compiler.
    - It is the native method of referring HTML elements.

Issue:
    - Adding or removing elements in page design will cause change in index number,
      which we have update every time.
